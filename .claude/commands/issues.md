# GitHub Issue Creation Template - Next.js Profile Project

You are an AI assistant tasked with creating well-structured GitHub issues for this Next.js 14 profile project. Your goal is to turn the provided feature description into a comprehensive GitHub issue that follows best practices and project conventions.

First, you will be given a feature description and a repository URL. Here they are:

<feature_description>
#$ARGUMENTS
</feature_description>

<repository_url>
#$REPO_URL
</repository_url>

## Project Context
This is a minimal Next.js 14 application using the App Router, designed for deployment to Vercel. The project follows modern Next.js conventions with a clean, minimal structure.

## TODO List

Follow these steps to complete the task systematically:

### Phase 1: Repository Research
- [ ] Visit the provided repository URL and examine the project structure
- [ ] Review existing issues to understand the project's issue patterns and conventions
- [ ] Look for CONTRIBUTING.md, ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md, or .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ files
- [ ] Identify the project's coding style and naming conventions
- [ ] Note any specific requirements for submitting issues
- [ ] Review the README.md for project context and contribution guidelines
- [ ] Check for labels, milestones, and project boards to understand workflow

### Phase 2: Best Practices Research
- [ ] Search for current best practices in writing GitHub issues
- [ ] Focus on clarity, completeness, and actionability principles

### Phase 3: Issue Classification
- [ ] Determine if this is a feature request, bug report, or improvement
- [ ] Identify the appropriate issue template to follow (if available)
- [ ] Select relevant labels based on repository conventions
- [ ] Assess priority and complexity level

### Phase 4: Issue Structure Creation
- [ ] Write a clear, descriptive title (50-72 characters recommended)
- [ ] Create a comprehensive description following this structure:
  - [ ] **Summary**: Brief overview of the request/issue
  - [ ] **Problem Statement**: What problem does this solve?
  - [ ] **Proposed Solution**: Detailed description of the requested feature/fix
  - [ ] **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear, testable conditions for completion
  - [ ] **Additional Context**: Screenshots, examples, or related issues
  - [ ] **Implementation Notes**: Technical considerations (if applicable)

### Phase 5: Quality Assurance
- [ ] Ensure the issue is actionable and specific
- [ ] Verify all necessary information is included
- [ ] Check for proper formatting and readability
- [ ] Confirm alignment with project conventions
- [ ] Add appropriate labels, assignees, and milestones

- [ ] Vercel deployment works correctly
```

## Final Output Requirements

After completing all research and planning phases, provide:

1. **Repository Analysis Summary**: Key findings about the project's conventions
2. **Complete GitHub Issue**: Fully formatted issue ready to submit
3. **Recommended Labels**: Suggest appropriate labels based on repository standards
4. **Priority Assessment**: Recommended priority level with justification

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, ensure the issue meets these criteria:
- [ ] Title is clear and descriptive
- [ ] Problem is well-defined and justified
- [ ] Solution is specific and actionable

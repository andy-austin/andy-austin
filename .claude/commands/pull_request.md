# GitHub Pull Request Creation Template - Next.js Profile Project

You are an AI assistant tasked with creating well-structured GitHub pull requests for this Next.js 14 profile project. Your goal is to turn the provided code changes and context into a comprehensive PR that facilitates effective code review and maintains project quality.

First, you will be given the change description and repository context. Here they are:

<change_description>
#$ARGUMENTS
</change_description>

<repository_url>
#$REPO_URL
</repository_url>

<branch_info>
Source Branch: #$SOURCE_BRANCH
Target Branch: #$TARGET_BRANCH
</branch_info>

## Project Context
This is a minimal Next.js 14 application using the App Router, designed for deployment to Vercel. The project follows modern Next.js conventions with a clean, minimal structure.

## TODO List

Follow these steps to create an exceptional pull request:

### Phase 1: Repository Analysis
- [ ] **PRIMARY**: Check for existing PR templates in `.github/pull_request_template.md` or `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/`
- [ ] If templates exist, use them as the base structure and adapt content accordingly
- [ ] Review existing PRs to understand the project's merge patterns and conventions
- [ ] Check for CONTRIBUTING.md or PR guidelines in .github/ or root directory
- [ ] Identify the project's code review process and requirements
- [ ] Note any automated checks (CI/CD, linting, testing requirements)
- [ ] Review branch protection rules and merge requirements
- [ ] Understand the project's versioning and release process
- [ ] Look for custom PR labels, reviewers, and assignment patterns

### Phase 2: Code Change Analysis
- [ ] Review all modified files and understand the scope of changes
- [ ] Identify the type of change (feature, bugfix, refactor, docs, etc.)
- [ ] Assess the impact on existing functionality
- [ ] Verify that changes align with the original issue/requirement
- [ ] Check for any breaking changes or deprecations
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling and edge cases are covered

### Phase 3: Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` to ensure code follows ESLint rules
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to verify build succeeds
- [ ] Test in development mode with `npm run dev`
- [ ] Verify Next.js App Router patterns are followed
- [ ] Check that code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Validate that documentation is updated if needed
- [ ] Confirm no sensitive information is exposed
- [ ] Verify Vercel deployment compatibility

### Phase 4: PR Content Creation
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: If `.github/pull_request_template.md` exists, use it as the base template
- [ ] Fill in the existing template sections with relevant information
- [ ] If no template exists, use the fallback structure provided below
- [ ] Write a clear, descriptive title following project conventions
- [ ] Link related issues and dependencies using project's preferred format
- [ ] Add appropriate labels and reviewers based on repository patterns
- [ ] Include screenshots or demos for UI changes (if template requires)
- [ ] Document any migration steps or deployment notes in appropriate sections

### Phase 5: Review Preparation
- [ ] Self-review the changes one final time
- [ ] Ensure commit messages are clear and conventional
- [ ] Verify the PR is ready for review (not draft)
- [ ] Check that all CI checks are passing
- [ ] Confirm the PR targets the correct base branch

## PR Template Strategy

### Template Detection and Usage

1. **Primary**: Check for existing repository PR templates:
   - `.github/pull_request_template.md`
   - `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
   - `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` directory with multiple templates

2. **If existing templates found**:
   - Use the repository's template as the base structure
   - Fill in all required sections with relevant information
   - Maintain the exact format and section order
   - Respect any custom fields or requirements
   - Follow any specific instructions or guidelines in the template

3. **If no templates found**:
   - Use the fallback template structure provided below
   - Adapt the structure based on project conventions observed in existing PRs

### Repository Template Integration Process

```markdown
## Step 1: Fetch Existing Template
<!-- Check for and retrieve the repository's PR template -->

## Step 2: Analyze Template Structure
<!-- Identify required vs optional sections -->
<!-- Note any custom fields or project-specific requirements -->

## Step 3: Map Content to Template
<!-- Fill existing template sections with appropriate content -->
<!-- Ensure all required fields are completed -->

## Step 4: Enhance Where Appropriate
<!-- Add additional context if template allows -->
<!-- Follow template's tone and style -->
```

## Fallback PR Template Structure
*Use this structure ONLY if no repository template exists*

### Title Format
```
[TYPE]: Brief description of changes (#issue-number)
```
Where TYPE is: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, etc.

### PR Body Template
```markdown
## Description
